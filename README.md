# Deeplifting 🧠
This repository delves into a research field we refer to as "deeplifting". Deeplifting merges the domains of deep learning and optimization, proposing a novel approach to solve optimization problems. By using neural networks to reparameterize input spaces, we can significantly improve solutions, making them both more potent and robust.
